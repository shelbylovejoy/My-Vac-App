# My-Vac-App

The 2023 theme for the annual HackUA was GreenHack - Technological Innovation for a Sustainable Future. Armed with the task of developing a product solution that fosters and ensures a more sustainable future and focuses on the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals, my team decided to look at Goal #3 - Ensure Healthy Lives and Promote Well-Being For All. We created an app with the goal of reducing the data-supported gaps in immunization coverage, providing an affordable and accessible way for families to access all their vaccine information.

Check out the UAHackathon PowerPoint for more presentation information.
